# Summary

This is an automatic general purpose grain dispenser. It could be used to dispense specific amounts of granural stuff such as pet food, coffee, sugar, fertilizer, sand or watever you'd like.

Update 13 Jun 2018:
- Added a leg structure to lift the base from ground
- Added a nozzle part (this part is a little tricky to print. It needs support due to the extreme overhangs)
- Added a container with two options. It can either be used with a lid or with four extenders wich hold the plastic bag of the material.


Note: Currently having issues with the steady flow of the material from the container to the machine (I'm testing with pet food wich is irregularly shaped and gets stuck in the cointainer hole). Maybe adding a servo with an arm that makes a sweep when needed will assist the flow and solve the problem.

Features:
- Powered by a NEMA17 stepper motor
- Dedicated electronics enclosure at the front with easy access
- A cable channel that runs from the front all the way to the back, keeps your wires clean an hidden
- Easy to print and assemble.


BOM:
- 1x NEMA17 stepper motor
- 1x microcontroller (arduino or similar)
- 1x stepper motor driver
- 1x female DC power plug connector 8mmOD
- wires
- 1x 12VDC power supply (2A or higher)
- 9x screws M4x20 for the main body subassembly and the motor mount connection with the main body
- 4x machine screws M3x8 to secure the motor to the motor mount
- 2x machine screws M4x6 for the power cord mount
- 6x machine screws M4x20 for the leg structure and the nozzle
- 1x small container of superglue to secure the two auger parts together as well as the container and the container base

This design is actually in testing phase so all information provided here may be subject to change. But you can print it and built it. It works fine.

Feel free to comment any suggestions or flaws.
